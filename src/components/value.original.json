                "text": "The most important problems in science are increasingly interdisciplinary [x]

                This means we have a growing interdisciplinary “burden of knowledge” [x] - intuitively, the “overhead” we have to pay to get into a position to do the science is getting bigger and bigger
                
                We’re coping with this (for now)...
                With more specialized education [x]
                Scientists are increasingly older when they win a Nobel prize and when they get their first PhD [x]
                By doing more science in teams [x, x]
                
                But how long can this last? We’re starting to see some signs of strain
                While research effort has skyrocketed, research productivity (ratio of impact/breakthroughs to effort) has stagnated or declined [x]
                
                Primary conjecture: the growing interdisciplinary burden of knowledge is straining the infrastructure we use to synthesize knowledge
                
                Infrastructure is invisible until it fails
                
                Primary “big question”: What infrastructures can we build to secure the long-term health of open, collaborative, interdisciplinary science?
