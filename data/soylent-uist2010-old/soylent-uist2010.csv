22,soylent-uist2010.pdf_22,"As a step toward integrating this human expertise permanently into our writing tools, we present Soylent, a word processing interface that utilizes crowd contributions to aid complex writing tasks ranging from error prevention and paragraph shortening to automation of tasks like citation searches and tense changes.",
23,soylent-uist2010.pdf_23,We hypothesize that crowd workers with a basic knowledge of written English can support both novice and expert writers.,
24,soylent-uist2010.pdf_24,"These workers perform tasks that the writer might not, such as scrupulously scanning for text to cut, or updating a list of addresses to include a zip code.",

26,soylent-uist2010.pdf_26,Soylent aids the writing process by integrating paid crowd workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform1 into Microsoft Word.,
27,soylent-uist2010.pdf_27,Soylent is people: its core algorithms involve calls to Mechanical Turk workers (Turkers).,
28,soylent-uist2010.pdf_28,"Soylent is comprised of three main components: 1) Shortn, a text shortening service that cuts selected text down to 85% of its original length typically without changing the meaning of the text or introducing errors.",

31,soylent-uist2010.pdf_31,The main contribution of this paper is the idea of embedding paid crowd workers in an interactive user interface to support complex cognition and manipulation tasks on demand.,
32,soylent-uist2010.pdf_32,These crowd workers do tasks that computers cannot reliably do automatically and the user cannot easily script.,
33,soylent-uist2010.pdf_33,"This paper contributes the design of one such system, an implementation embedded in Microsoft Word, and a programming pattern that increases the reliability of paid crowd workers on complex tasks.",

35,soylent-uist2010.pdf_35,The fundamental technical contribution of this work is a crowd programming pattern called Find-Fix-Verify.,
36,soylent-uist2010.pdf_36,"Mechanical Turk costs money and it can be error-prone; to be worthwhile to the user, we must control costs and ensure correctness.",
37,soylent-uist2010.pdf_37,Find-Fix-Verify splits complex crowd intelligence tasks into a series of generation and review stages that utilize independent agreement and voting to produce reliable results.,
38,soylent-uist2010.pdf_38,"Rather than ask a single crowd worker to read and edit an entire paragraph, for example, Find-FixVerify recruits one set of workers to find candidate areas for improvement, then collects a set of candidate improvements, and finally filters out incorrect candidates.",
39,soylent-uist2010.pdf_39,"This process prevents errant crowd workers from contributing too much, too little, or introducing errors into the document.",
40,soylent-uist2010.pdf_40,"Soylent is influenced by prior work on crowdsourced interfaces (e.g., [1, 9, 24]).",
41,soylent-uist2010.pdf_41,Such work has generally aggregated previous crowd interactions rather than recruited an ondemand workforce for new requests.,
42,soylent-uist2010.pdf_42,"Instead of training on previous users, we ask crowd workers to solve personalized tasks on demand each time.",
43,soylent-uist2010.pdf_43,This interface-for-hire model has benefits and limitations that we explore in this paper.,

46,soylent-uist2010.pdf_46,We detail the Find-Fix-Verify pattern that powers Soylent; evaluate the feasibility of our three components; and conclude with a discussion of privacy issues and inherent limitations of our approach.,
47,soylent-uist2010.pdf_47,"RELATED WORK Soylent is related to work in two areas: crowdsourcing systems, and artificial intelligence for word processing.",
48,soylent-uist2010.pdf_48,Crowdsourcing Gathering data to train algorithms is a common use of crowdsourcing.,
49,soylent-uist2010.pdf_49,"For example, the ESP Game [27] collects descriptions of objects in images for use in object recognition.",
50,soylent-uist2010.pdf_50,Mechanical Turk is already used to collect labeled data for machine vision [26] and natural language processing [25].,
51,soylent-uist2010.pdf_51,"Soylent tackles problems that are currently infeasible for AI algorithms, even with abundant data.",
52,soylent-uist2010.pdf_52,"However, Soylent's output may be used to train future AIs.",
53,soylent-uist2010.pdf_53,Several systems power novel interactions with the wisdom of crowds.,
54,soylent-uist2010.pdf_54,HelpMeOut [9] collects debugging traces and applies others' error solutions to help fix code.,
55,soylent-uist2010.pdf_55,FeedMe [1] and Collabio [2] use friends to power recommender systems and tag cloud visualizations.,

58,soylent-uist2010.pdf_58,"Soylent is unique in asking paid crowd workers to solve the user's problems, rather than aggregating past activity.",
59,soylent-uist2010.pdf_59,Having an 3 on-demand workforce also expands the realm of tasks we can support beyond those requiring traces or incentives.,
60,soylent-uist2010.pdf_60,Soylent builds on work embedding on-demand workforces inside applications and services.,
61,soylent-uist2010.pdf_61,ChaCha2 recruits humans to do search engine queries for users who are mobile; Amazon Remembers uses Mechanical Turk to find products that match a photo taken by the user on a phone; Sala et al.,
62,soylent-uist2010.pdf_62,'s PEST [23] uses Mechanical Turk to vet advertisement recommendations.,
63,soylent-uist2010.pdf_63,These systems consist of a single user operation and little or no interaction.,
64,soylent-uist2010.pdf_64,"Soylent extends this work to more creative, complex tasks where the user can make personalized requests and interact with the returned data by direct manipulation.",

67,soylent-uist2010.pdf_67,"By contrast, Soylent is embedded in a word processor, has much lower latency, and presents the edits in Microsoft Word's user interface.",
68,soylent-uist2010.pdf_68,Our work also contributes the Find-Fix-Verify pattern to improve the quality of such proofreading services.,
69,soylent-uist2010.pdf_69,Soylent's usage of human computation means that its behavior depends in large part on qualities of crowdsourcing systems and Mechanical Turk in particular.,
70,soylent-uist2010.pdf_70,"Recently, Ross et al.",
71,soylent-uist2010.pdf_71,"found that Mechanical Turk had two major populations: well-educated, moderate-income Americans, and young, well-educated but less wealthy workers from India [22].",
72,soylent-uist2010.pdf_72,"Kittur and Chi considered how to run user studies on Mechanical Turk, proposing the use of quantitative verifiable questions as a verification mechanism [11].",
73,soylent-uist2010.pdf_73,Find-FixVerify builds on this notion of requiring verification to control quality.,
74,soylent-uist2010.pdf_74,"Heer and Bostock explored Mechanical Turk as a testbed for graphical perception experiments, finding reliable results when they implemented basic measures like qualification tests [10].",
75,soylent-uist2010.pdf_75,Little et al.,

77,soylent-uist2010.pdf_77,Find-Fix-Verify may be viewed as a new design pattern for human computation algorithms.,
78,soylent-uist2010.pdf_78,"It is specifically intended to control lazy and overeager Turkers, identify which edits are tied to the same problem, and visualize them in an interface.",
79,soylent-uist2010.pdf_79,Quinn and Bederson have authored a survey of human computation systems that expands on this brief review [21].,
80,soylent-uist2010.pdf_80,Artificial Intelligence for Word Processing Automatic proofreading has a long history of research [14] and has seen successful deployment in word processors.,
81,soylent-uist2010.pdf_81,"However, Microsoft Word's spell checker frequently suffers from false positives, particularly with proper nouns and unusual names.",
82,soylent-uist2010.pdf_82,"Its grammar checker suffers from the opposite problem: it misses blatant errors.4 Human checkers are currently more reliable, and can also offer suggestions on how to fix the errors they find, which is not always possible 2 http://www.chacha.com 3 http://www.standardminds.com 4 http://faculty.washington.edu/sandeep/check Figure 1.",
83,soylent-uist2010.pdf_83,Shortn allows users to adjust the length of a paragraph via a slider.,

87,soylent-uist2010.pdf_87,"Soylent's Shortn component is related to document summarization, which has also received substantial research attention [18].",
88,soylent-uist2010.pdf_88,"Microsoft Word has a summarization feature that uses sentence extraction, which identifies whole sentences to preserve in a passage and deletes the rest, producing substantial shortening but at a great cost in content.",
89,soylent-uist2010.pdf_89,"Shortn's approach, which can rewrite or cut parts of sentences, is an example of sentence compression, an area of active recent research [5, 12] that suffers from a lack of training data [4].",
90,soylent-uist2010.pdf_90,The Human Macro is related to AI techniques for end-user programming.,
91,soylent-uist2010.pdf_91,"Several systems allow users to demonstrate repetitive editing tasks for automatic execution; examples include Eager, TELS, and Cima [6], LAPIS [20], and SmartEdit [15].",
92,soylent-uist2010.pdf_92,Other work has considered naturallanguage-like programming syntax (e.g. [17]).,
93,soylent-uist2010.pdf_93,"SOYLENT Soylent is a prototype crowdsourced word processing interface with three features: shortening, proofreading, and arbitrary macro tasks via human-language input.",
94,soylent-uist2010.pdf_94,Shortn: Text Shortening Some authors struggle to remain within length limits on papers and spend the last hours of the writing process tweaking paragraphs to shave a few lines.,
95,soylent-uist2010.pdf_95,This is painful work and a questionable use of the authors' time.,
96,soylent-uist2010.pdf_96,Other writers write overly wordy prose and need help editing.,
97,soylent-uist2010.pdf_97,"Automatic summarization algorithms can provide useful summaries [18], but cannot easily determine what language to cut or shorten.",
98,soylent-uist2010.pdf_98,"Additionally, they cannot use language generation techniques to make sure the resulting text flows.",
99,soylent-uist2010.pdf_99,Soylent's Shortn interface allows authors to condense sections of text.,
100,soylent-uist2010.pdf_100,The user selects the area of text that is too long—for example a paragraph or section—then presses the Shortn button in the Word's Soylent ribbon tab.,
101,soylent-uist2010.pdf_101,"In response, Soylent launches a series of Mechanical Turk tasks in the background and notifies the user when the text is ready.",
102,soylent-uist2010.pdf_102,The user can then launch the Shortn dialog box (Figure 1).,
103,soylent-uist2010.pdf_103,On the left is the original paragraph; on the right is the proposed revision.,
104,soylent-uist2010.pdf_104,Shortn provides a single slider to allow the user to continuously adjust the length of the paragraph.,
105,soylent-uist2010.pdf_105,"As the user does so, Shortn computes the combination of crowd trimmings that most closely match the desired length and presents that text to the user on the right.",
106,soylent-uist2010.pdf_106,"From the user's point of view, as she moves the slider to make the paragraph shorter, sentences are slightly edited, combined and cut completely to match the length requirement.",
107,soylent-uist2010.pdf_107,Areas of text that have been edited or removed are highlighted in red in the visualization.,
108,soylent-uist2010.pdf_108,These areas may differ from one slider position to the next: the cuts are not monotonic in this sense.,
109,soylent-uist2010.pdf_109,"Shortn typically can remove up to 15–30% of a paragraph in a single pass, and up to ~50% with multiple iterations.",
110,soylent-uist2010.pdf_110,"The Shortn algorithm preserves meaning when possible, so it cuts unnecessary language or concept repetition.",
111,soylent-uist2010.pdf_111,Removing whole arguments or sections is left to the user.,
112,soylent-uist2010.pdf_112,"Crowdproof: Crowdsourced Proofreading Soylent provides a human-aided spelling, grammar and style checking interface called Crowdproof (Figure 2).",

114,soylent-uist2010.pdf_114,"The process finds errors, explains the problem, and offers one to five alternative rewrites.",
115,soylent-uist2010.pdf_115,Crowdproof is essentially a distributed proofreader operating for cents per task.,
116,soylent-uist2010.pdf_116,"To use Crowdproof, the user highlights a section of text and presses the proofreading button in the Soylent ribbon tab.",
117,soylent-uist2010.pdf_117,The task is queued to the Soylent status pane and the user is free to keep working.,
118,soylent-uist2010.pdf_118,"(Because Crowdproof costs money, it does not issue requests unless commanded.)",
119,soylent-uist2010.pdf_119,Figure 2.,
120,soylent-uist2010.pdf_120,Crowdproof is a human-augmented proofreader.,
121,soylent-uist2010.pdf_121,The drop-down explains the problem (blue title) and suggests fixes (gold selection).,
122,soylent-uist2010.pdf_122,"When the crowd is finished, Soylent calls out the edited sections with a purple dashed underline.",
123,soylent-uist2010.pdf_123,"If the user clicks on the error, a drop-down menu explains the problem and offers a list of alternatives.",
124,soylent-uist2010.pdf_124,"By clicking on the desired alternative, the user replaces the incorrect text with an option of his or her choice.",

127,soylent-uist2010.pdf_127,"Typically, users need to translate their intentions into algorithmic thinking explicitly via a scripting language or implicitly through learned activity [6].",
128,soylent-uist2010.pdf_128,But tasks conveyed to humans can be written in a much more natural way.,
129,soylent-uist2010.pdf_129,"While natural language command interfaces continue to struggle with unconstrained input over a large search space, humans are good at understanding written instructions.",
130,soylent-uist2010.pdf_130,The Human Macro is Soylent's natural language command interface.,
131,soylent-uist2010.pdf_131,Soylent users can use it to request arbitrary work quickly in human language.,
132,soylent-uist2010.pdf_132,Launching the Human Macro opens a request form (Figure 3).,
133,soylent-uist2010.pdf_133,The design challenge here is to ensure that the user creates tasks that are scoped correctly for a Mechanical Turk worker.,
134,soylent-uist2010.pdf_134,We wish to prevent the user from spending money on a buggy command.,
135,soylent-uist2010.pdf_135,"The form dialog is split in two mirrored pieces: a task entry form on the left, and a preview of what the Turker will see on the right.",
136,soylent-uist2010.pdf_136,"The preview contextualizes the user's request, reminding the user he is writing something akin to a Help Wanted or Craigslist advertisement.",
137,soylent-uist2010.pdf_137,"The form suggests that the user provide an example input and output, which is an effective way to clarify the task requirements to workers.",
138,soylent-uist2010.pdf_138,"If the user selected text before opening the dialog, he has the option to split the task by each sentence or paragraph, so (for example) the task might be parallelized across all entries on a list.",
139,soylent-uist2010.pdf_139,The user then chooses how many separate Turkers he would like to complete the task.,
140,soylent-uist2010.pdf_140,The Human Macro helps debug the task by allowing a test run on one sentence or paragraph.,
141,soylent-uist2010.pdf_141,The user chooses whether the Turkers' work should replace the existing text or just annotate it.,
142,soylent-uist2010.pdf_142,"If the user chooses to replace, the Human Macro underlines the text in purple and enables drop-down substitution like the Crowdproof interface.",

148,soylent-uist2010.pdf_148,We introduce the Find-Fix-Verify pattern to improve output quality in the face of uncertain worker quality.,
149,soylent-uist2010.pdf_149,"Over the past year, we have performed and documented dozens of experiments on Mechanical Turk.5 For this project alone, we have interacted with 8809 Turkers across 2256 different tasks.",
150,soylent-uist2010.pdf_150,We draw on this experience in the sections to follow.,
151,soylent-uist2010.pdf_151,Challenges in Programming with Crowd Workers We are primarily concerned with tasks where workers directly edit a user's data in an open-ended manner.,
152,soylent-uist2010.pdf_152,"These tasks include shortening, proofreading, and user-requested changes such as address formatting.",
153,soylent-uist2010.pdf_153,"In our experiments, it is evident that many of the raw results that Turkers produce on such tasks are unsatisfactory.",
154,soylent-uist2010.pdf_154,"As a rule-of-thumb, roughly 30% of the results from open-ended tasks are poor.",
155,soylent-uist2010.pdf_155,"This ""30% rule"" is supported by the experimental section of this paper as well.",
156,soylent-uist2010.pdf_156,"Clearly, a 30% error rate is unacceptable to the end user.",
157,soylent-uist2010.pdf_157,"To address the problem, it is important to understand the nature of unsatisfactory responses.",
158,soylent-uist2010.pdf_158,High Variance of Effort Turkers exhibit high variance in the amount of effort they invest in a task.,
159,soylent-uist2010.pdf_159,"We might characterize two useful personas at the ends of the effort spectrum, the Lazy Turker and the Eager Beaver.",
160,soylent-uist2010.pdf_160,The Lazy Turker does as little work as necessary to get paid.,
161,soylent-uist2010.pdf_161,"For example, when asked to proofread the following error-filled paragraph from a high school essay site,6 a Lazy Turker inserted only a single character to correct a spelling mistake.",
162,soylent-uist2010.pdf_162,The change is highlighted: The theme of loneliness features throughout many scenes in Of Mice and Men and is often the dominant theme of sections during this story.,
163,soylent-uist2010.pdf_163,This theme occurs during many circumstances but is not present from start to finish.,
164,soylent-uist2010.pdf_164,In my mind for a theme to be pervasive is must be present during every element of the story.,
165,soylent-uist2010.pdf_165,"There are many themes that are present most of the way through such as sacrifice, friendship and comradeship.",
166,soylent-uist2010.pdf_166,"But in my opinion there is only one theme that is present from beginning to end, this theme is pursuit of dreams.",
167,soylent-uist2010.pdf_167,A first challenge is thus to discourage or prevent workers from such behavior.,
168,soylent-uist2010.pdf_168,Kittur et al.,
169,soylent-uist2010.pdf_169,"attacked the problem of 5 http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/deneme/ 6 http://www.essay.org/school/english/ofmiceandmen.txt Lazy Turkers in crowdsourced user studies [12] by adding clearly verifiable, quantitative questions (e.g., ""How many sections does the article have?"")",
170,soylent-uist2010.pdf_170,that forced the Lazy Turker to read the material being studied.,
171,soylent-uist2010.pdf_171,Equally problematic as Lazy Turkers are Eager Beavers.,
172,soylent-uist2010.pdf_172,"Eager Beavers go beyond the task requirements in order to be helpful, but create further work for the user in the process.",
173,soylent-uist2010.pdf_173,"For example, when asked to reword a phrase, one Eager Beaver provided a litany of options: The theme of loneliness features throughout many scenes in Of Mice and Men and is often the principal, significant, primary, preeminent, prevailing, foremost, essential, crucial, vital, critical theme of sections during this story.",
174,soylent-uist2010.pdf_174,"In their zeal, this worker rendered the resulting sentence ungrammatical.",
175,soylent-uist2010.pdf_175,Eager Beavers may also leave extra comments in the document or reformat paragraphs.,
176,soylent-uist2010.pdf_176,It would be problematic to funnel such work back to the user.,
177,soylent-uist2010.pdf_177,Both the Lazy Turker and the Eager Beaver are looking for a way to clearly signal to the requester that they have completed the work.,
178,soylent-uist2010.pdf_178,"Without clear guidelines, the Lazy Turker will choose the path that produces any signal and the Eager Beaver will produce too many signals.",
179,soylent-uist2010.pdf_179,Turkers Introduce Errors Turkers working on complex tasks can accidentally introduce substantial new errors.,
180,soylent-uist2010.pdf_180,"For example, when proofreading paragraphs about the novel Of Mice and Men, Turkers variously changed the title to just Of Mice, replaced existing grammar errors with new errors of their own, and changed the text to state that Of Mice and Men is a movie rather than a novel.",
181,soylent-uist2010.pdf_181,Such errors are compounded if the output of one Turker is used as input for other Turkers.,
182,soylent-uist2010.pdf_182,The Find-Fix-Verify Pattern Our crowdsourced interface algorithms must control the efforts of both the Eager Beaver and Lazy Turker and limit introduction of errors.,
183,soylent-uist2010.pdf_183,"Absent suitable control techniques, the rate of problematic edits is too high to be useful.",
184,soylent-uist2010.pdf_184,"We feel that the state of programming crowds is analogous to that of UI technology before the introduction of design patterns like Model-View-Controller, which codified best practices.",
185,soylent-uist2010.pdf_185,"In this section, we propose the Find-Fix-Verify pattern as one method of programming crowds to reliably complete open-ended tasks that directly edit the user's data.",
186,soylent-uist2010.pdf_186,We describe the pattern and then explain its use in Soylent.,
187,soylent-uist2010.pdf_187,Find-Fix-Verify The Find-Fix-Verify pattern separates open-ended tasks into three stages where workers can make clear contributions.,
188,soylent-uist2010.pdf_188,"The first stage, Find, asks Turkers to identify patches of the user's work that need more attention.",
189,soylent-uist2010.pdf_189,"For example, when proofreading, the Find stage asks for at least one phrase or sentence that needs editing (Figure 4).",
190,soylent-uist2010.pdf_190,Any single Turker may produce a noisy result (e.g. Lazy Turkers might prefer errors near the beginning of a paragraph).,
191,soylent-uist2010.pdf_191,The Find stage aggregates independent opinions to find the most consistently cited problems: multiple independent agreement is typically a strong signal that a crowd is correct.,
192,soylent-uist2010.pdf_192,"the interface needs a default choice, Soylent keeps patches where at least 20% of the workers agree.",
193,soylent-uist2010.pdf_193,These are then fed in parallel into the Fix stage.,
194,soylent-uist2010.pdf_194,The Fix stage recruits workers to revise a patch.,
195,soylent-uist2010.pdf_195,Each task now consists of a constrained edit to an area of interest.,
196,soylent-uist2010.pdf_196,The worker can see the entire paragraph but only edit the text directly containing the patch.,
197,soylent-uist2010.pdf_197,A small number (3–5) of workers propose revisions.,
198,soylent-uist2010.pdf_198,"Even if 30% of work is bad, 3– 5 submissions are sufficient to produce viable alternatives.",
199,soylent-uist2010.pdf_199,The Verify stage performs quality control on revisions.,
200,soylent-uist2010.pdf_200,We randomize the order of the unique alternatives generated in the Fix stage and ask 3–5 new workers to vote on them (Figure 4).,
201,soylent-uist2010.pdf_201,"We either ask Turkers to vote on the best option (when like Crowdproof) or to flag poor suggestions (when the interface requires as many options as possible, like Shortn).",
202,soylent-uist2010.pdf_202,"To ensure that Turkers cannot vote for their own work, we ban all Fix workers from participating in the Verify stage.",
203,soylent-uist2010.pdf_203,Pattern Discussion Why should tasks be split into independent Find-Fix-Verify stages?,
204,soylent-uist2010.pdf_204,"Why not let Turkers find an error and fix it, for increased efficiency and economy?",
205,soylent-uist2010.pdf_205,"Lazy Turkers will always choose the easiest error to fix, so combining Find and Fix will result in poor coverage.",
206,soylent-uist2010.pdf_206,"By splitting Find from Fix, we can direct Lazy Turkers to propose a fix to patches that they might otherwise ignore.",
207,soylent-uist2010.pdf_207,"Additionally, splitting Find and Fix enables us to merge work completed in parallel.",
208,soylent-uist2010.pdf_208,"Had each Turker edited the entire paragraph, we would not know which edits were trying to fix the same problem.",
209,soylent-uist2010.pdf_209,"By splitting Find and Fix, we can map edits to patches and produce a much richer user interface—for example, the multiple options in Crowdproof's replacement dropdown.",
210,soylent-uist2010.pdf_210,The Verify stage reduces noise in the returned result.,
211,soylent-uist2010.pdf_211,"Anecdotally, Turkers are better at vetting suggestions than they are at producing original work.",
212,soylent-uist2010.pdf_212,Independent agreement among Verify workers can help certify an edit as good or bad.,
213,soylent-uist2010.pdf_213,Verification trades off time lag with quality: a user who can tolerate more error but needs less time lag might opt not to verify work or use fewer verification workers.,
214,soylent-uist2010.pdf_214,One challenge that the Find-Fix-Verify pattern shares with other Mechanical Turk algorithms is that it can stall when workers are slow to accept the task.,
215,soylent-uist2010.pdf_215,"Rather than wait for ten Turkers to complete the Find task before moving on to Fix, a timeout parameter can force our algorithm to advance if a minimum threshold of workers have completed the work.",
216,soylent-uist2010.pdf_216,Find-Fix-Verify in Soylent Both Shortn and Crowdproof use the Find-Fix-Verify pattern.,
217,soylent-uist2010.pdf_217,We will use Shortn as an illustrative example.,
218,soylent-uist2010.pdf_218,"To provide the user with near-continuous control of paragraph length, Shortn should produce many alternative rewrites without changing the meaning of the original text or introduce7 7 Word's grammar checker, eight authors and six reviewers did not catch the error in this sentence.",
219,soylent-uist2010.pdf_219,"Crowdproof later did, and correctly suggested that ""introduce"" should be ""introducing"".",

222,soylent-uist2010.pdf_222,"Find-Fix-Verify identifies patches in need of editing, recruits workers to fix the patches, and votes to approve work.",
223,soylent-uist2010.pdf_223,We begin by splitting the input region into paragraphs.,
224,soylent-uist2010.pdf_224,The Find stage asks ten Turkers to identify candidate areas for shortening in each paragraph.,
225,soylent-uist2010.pdf_225,At least 20% of the Turkers must agree on a text region.,
226,soylent-uist2010.pdf_226,"Each agreed-upon patch moves on to the Fix stage, where five Turkers see it highlighted in the paragraph and are asked to shorten it, as well as determine if the patch can be cut entirely.",
227,soylent-uist2010.pdf_227,We now have a set of rewrites and votes on whether the text can be cut.,
228,soylent-uist2010.pdf_228,"If it can be cut, we introduce the empty string as a rewrite.",
229,soylent-uist2010.pdf_229,"In the Verify stage, five Turkers see a list of all the rewrites where each rewrite has been annotated using color and strikethroughs to highlight its differences from the original.",
230,soylent-uist2010.pdf_230,"Each Turker selects at least one rewrite that has significant spelling, grammar, or style problems, and at least one rewrite that significantly changes the meaning of the original sentence.",
231,soylent-uist2010.pdf_231,We use majority voting to remove problematic rewrites and to decide if the patch can be removed.,
232,soylent-uist2010.pdf_232,"At the end of the Verify stage, we have a set of candidate patches and a list of verified rewrites for each patch.",
233,soylent-uist2010.pdf_233,"To keep the algorithm responsive, we use a 15-minute timeout at each stage.",
234,soylent-uist2010.pdf_234,"We require a minimum of six workers in Find, three workers in Fix, and three workers in Verify.",
235,soylent-uist2010.pdf_235,"When the user specifies a desired maximum length, Shortn searches for the longest combination of rewrites subject to the length constraint.",
236,soylent-uist2010.pdf_236,This search is a special case of the knapsack problem and can be solved with a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm.,
237,soylent-uist2010.pdf_237,IMPLEMENTATION Soylent consists of a front-end application-level add-in to Microsoft Word and a back-end service to run Mechanical Turk tasks (Figure 4).,
238,soylent-uist2010.pdf_238,The Microsoft Word plug-in is written using Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).,
239,soylent-uist2010.pdf_239,Backend scripts use the TurKit Mechanical Turk toolkit [16].,
240,soylent-uist2010.pdf_240,"EVALUATION Our initial evaluation sought to establish evidence for Soylent's end-to-end feasibility, as well as to understand the properties of the Find-Fix-Verify design pattern.",
241,soylent-uist2010.pdf_241,Shortn Evaluation We evaluated Shortn quantitatively by running it on example texts.,
242,soylent-uist2010.pdf_242,"Our goal was to see how much Shortn could shorten text, as well as its associated cost and time characteristics.",
243,soylent-uist2010.pdf_243,"We collected five examples of texts that might be sent to Shortn, each between one and seven paragraphs long.",
244,soylent-uist2010.pdf_244,We chose these inputs to span from preliminary drafts to finished essays and from easily understood to dense technical material (Table I).,
245,soylent-uist2010.pdf_245,"To simulate a real-world deployment, we ran the algorithms with a timeout enabled and set to twenty minutes.",
246,soylent-uist2010.pdf_246,"We required 6–10 workers to complete the Find tasks and 3–5 workers to complete the Fix and Verify tasks: if a Find task failed to recruit even six workers, it might wait indefinitely.",
247,soylent-uist2010.pdf_247,"To be slightly generous while matching going rates on Mechanical Turk, we paid $0.08 per Find, $0.05 per Fix, and $0.04 per Verify.",
248,soylent-uist2010.pdf_248,Each resulting paragraph had many possible variations depending on the number of shortened alternatives that passed the Verify stage – we chose the shortest possible version for analysis and compared its length to the original paragraph.,
249,soylent-uist2010.pdf_249,"We also measured wait time, the time between posting the task and the worker accepting the task, and work time, the time between acceptance and submission.",
250,soylent-uist2010.pdf_250,"In all tasks, it was possible for the algorithm to stall while waiting for workers, having a large effect on averages.",
251,soylent-uist2010.pdf_251,"Therefore, we report medians, which are more robust to outliers.",
252,soylent-uist2010.pdf_252,Results Shortn produced revisions that were 78%–90% of the original document length.,
253,soylent-uist2010.pdf_253,"For reference, a reduction to 85% could slim an 113⁄4 page UIST draft down to 10 pages with no substantial cuts in the content.",
254,soylent-uist2010.pdf_254,Table I summarizes and gives examples of Shortn's behavior.,
255,soylent-uist2010.pdf_255,"Typically, Shortn focused on unnecessarily wordy phrases like ""are going to have to"" (Table I, Blog).",
256,soylent-uist2010.pdf_256,"Turkers merged sentences when patches spanned sentence boundaries (Table I, Classic UIST), and occasionally cut whole phrases or sentences.",
257,soylent-uist2010.pdf_257,"To investigate time characteristics, we separate the notion of wait time from work time.",
258,soylent-uist2010.pdf_258,"The vast majority of Shortn's running time is currently spent waiting, because it can take minutes or hours for Turkers to find and accept the task.",

332,soylent-uist2010.pdf_332,"Using the Verify stage to choose the best textual replacement, Soylent fixed 29 of the 33 errors it flagged (88%).",
333,soylent-uist2010.pdf_333,"To investigate the impact of the Verify stage, we labeled each unique correction that Turkers suggested as grammatical or not.",
334,soylent-uist2010.pdf_334,"Fully 28 of 62 suggestions, or 45%, were ungrammatical.",
335,soylent-uist2010.pdf_335,The fact that such noisy suggestions produced correct replacements again suggests that Turkers are much better at verification than they are at authoring.,
336,soylent-uist2010.pdf_336,Crowdproof's most common problem was missing a minor error that was in the same patch as a more egregious error.,
337,soylent-uist2010.pdf_337,The four errors that Crowdproof failed to fix were all contained in patches with at least one other error; Lazy Turkers fixed only the most noticeable problem.,
338,soylent-uist2010.pdf_338,"A second problem was a lack of domain knowledge: in the ESL example in Table II, Turkers did not know what a GUI was, so they could not know that the author intended ""GUIs"" instead of ""GUI"".",
339,soylent-uist2010.pdf_339,"There were also stylistic opinions that the original author might not have agreed with: in the Draft UIST example in Table II, the author clearly had a penchant for triple dashes that the Turkers did not appreciate.",
340,soylent-uist2010.pdf_340,Crowdproof shared many running characteristics with Shortn.,
341,soylent-uist2010.pdf_341,"Its median work time was 2.8 minutes (Q1 = 1.7 minutes, Q3 = 4.7 minutes), so it completes in very little work time.",
342,soylent-uist2010.pdf_342,"Similarly to Shortn, its wait time was 18 minutes (Median = 17.6, Q1 = 9.8, Q3 = 30.8).",
343,soylent-uist2010.pdf_343,"It cost more money to run per paragraph (μ=$3.40, σ=$2.13) because it identified far more patches per paragraph: we chose paragraphs in dire need of proofreading.",
344,soylent-uist2010.pdf_344,Human Macro Evaluation We were interested in understanding whether end users could instruct Mechanical Turk workers to perform openended tasks.,
345,soylent-uist2010.pdf_345,Can users communicate their intention clearly?,
346,soylent-uist2010.pdf_346,Can Turkers execute the amateur-authored tasks correctly?,
347,soylent-uist2010.pdf_347,Method We generated five feasible Human Macro scenarios (Table III).,
348,soylent-uist2010.pdf_348,We recruited two sets of users: five undergraduate and graduate students in our computer science department (4 male) and five administrative associates in our department (all female).,
349,soylent-uist2010.pdf_349,"We showed each user one of the five prompts, consisting of an example input and output pair.",
350,soylent-uist2010.pdf_350,We purposefully did not describe the task to the participants so that we would not influence how they wrote their task descriptions.,
351,soylent-uist2010.pdf_351,We then introduced participants to The Human Macro and described what it would do.,
352,soylent-uist2010.pdf_352,We asked them to write a task description for their prompt using The Human Macro.,
353,soylent-uist2010.pdf_353,We then sent the description to Mechanical Turk and requested that five Turkers complete each request.,
354,soylent-uist2010.pdf_354,"In addition to the ten requests generated by our participants, one author generated five requests himself to simulate a user who is familiar with Mechanical Turk.",
355,soylent-uist2010.pdf_355,We coded results using two quality metrics: intention (did the Turker understand the prompt and make a good faith effort?),
356,soylent-uist2010.pdf_356,and accuracy (was the result flawless?).,
357,soylent-uist2010.pdf_357,"If the Turker completed the task but made a small error, the result was coded as good intention and poor accuracy.",
358,soylent-uist2010.pdf_358,Results Users were generally successful at communicating their intention (Table III).,
359,soylent-uist2010.pdf_359,"The average command saw an 88% intention success rate (max = 100%, min = 60%).",
360,soylent-uist2010.pdf_360,"Typical intention errors occurred when the prompt contained two requirements: for example, the Figure task asked both for Task Tense $0.10 1 paragraph Figure $0.20 1 paragraph Quality CS: 100% intention, (20% accuracy) Admin: 100% (40%) Author: 100% (60%) CS: 75% (75%) Admin: 75% (75%) Author: 60% (60%) Opinions $0.15 1 paragraph CS: 100% (100%) Admin: 100% (100%) Author: 100% (100%) Citation Gathering $0.40 3 citations CS: 75% (75%) Admin: 100% (100%) Author: 66% (40%) Example Request Admin: ""Please change text in document from past tense to present tense.""",

391,soylent-uist2010.pdf_391,"Lag times in our current implementation are still on the order of minutes to hours, due to worker demographics, worker availability, the relative attractiveness of our tasks, and so on.",
392,soylent-uist2010.pdf_392,"While future growth in crowdsourced work will likely shorten lag times, this is an important avenue of future work.",
393,soylent-uist2010.pdf_393,"It may be possible to explicitly engineer for responsiveness in return for higher monetary investment, or to keep workers on retainer with distractor tasks until needed [3].",
394,soylent-uist2010.pdf_394,"With respect to cost, Soylent requires that authors pay all workers for document editing — even if many changes never find their way into the final work product.",
395,soylent-uist2010.pdf_395,One might therefore argue that interface outsourcing is too expensive to be practical.,
396,soylent-uist2010.pdf_396,"We counter that in fact all current document processing tasks also incur significant cost (in terms of computing infrastructure, time, software and salaries); the only difference is that interface outsourcing precisely quantifies the price of each small unit of work.",
397,soylent-uist2010.pdf_397,"While paymentper-edit may restrict deployment to commercial contexts, it remains an open question whether the gains in productivity for the author are justified by the expense.",
398,soylent-uist2010.pdf_398,"Regarding privacy, Soylent exposes the author's document to third party workers without knowing the workers' identities.",
399,soylent-uist2010.pdf_399,Authors and their employers may not want such exposure if the document's content is confidential or otherwise sensitive.,
400,soylent-uist2010.pdf_400,"One solution is to restrict the set of workers that can perform tasks: for example, large companies could maintain internal worker pools.",
401,soylent-uist2010.pdf_401,"Rather than a binary opposition, a continuum of privacy and exposure options exists.",
402,soylent-uist2010.pdf_402,"Soylent also raises questions over legal ownership of the resulting text, which is part-user and part-Turker generated.",
403,soylent-uist2010.pdf_403,Do the Turkers who participate in Find-Fix-Verify gain any legal rights to the document?,
404,soylent-uist2010.pdf_404,"We believe not: the Mechanical Turk worker contract explicitly states that it is workfor-hire, so results belong to the requester.",
405,soylent-uist2010.pdf_405,Likewise with historical precedent: traditional copyeditors do not own their edits to an article.,
406,soylent-uist2010.pdf_406,"However, crowdsourced interfaces will need to consider legal questions carefully.",
407,soylent-uist2010.pdf_407,A final concern is that anonymous workers may not have the necessary domain knowledge or enough shared context to usefully contribute.,
408,soylent-uist2010.pdf_408,"We agree that some tasks, like fleshing out a related work section in an academic paper based on bullet points, are much more difficult to achieve on today's Mechanical Turk.",
409,soylent-uist2010.pdf_409,"However, a large subset of editing tasks only requires generic editing skills.",
410,soylent-uist2010.pdf_410,We also may effectively personalize by directing tasks to Turkers who have successfully worked on a user's documents before.,
411,soylent-uist2010.pdf_411,"CONCLUSION The following conclusion was Shortn'ed to 85% length: This paper presents Soylent, a word processing interface that uses crowd workers to help with proofreading, document shortening, editing and commenting tasks.",
412,soylent-uist2010.pdf_412,Soylent is an example of a new kind of interactive user interface in which the end user has direct access to a crowd of workers for assistance with tasks that require human attention and common sense.,
413,soylent-uist2010.pdf_413,"Implementing these kinds of interfaces requires new software programming patterns for interface software, since crowds behave differently than computer systems.",

416,soylent-uist2010.pdf_416,Future work falls in three categories.,
417,soylent-uist2010.pdf_417,"First are new crowddriven features for word processing, such as readability analysis, smart find-and-replace (so that renaming ""Michael"" to ""Michelle"" also changes ""he"" to ""she""), and figure or citation number checking.",
418,soylent-uist2010.pdf_418,Second are new techniques for optimizing crowd-programmed algorithms to reduce wait time and cost.,
419,soylent-uist2010.pdf_419,"Finally, we believe that our research points the way toward integrating on-demand crowd work into other authoring interfaces, particularly in creative domains like image editing and programming.",
